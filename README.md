# NineSevenThree

NineSevenThree is a simplified, responsive CSS grid framework. It's originally a base framework designed for my future web projects, but I have decided to add some stuffs and release it for public use.

It's still in early stage, and more things will be added in the future. In the meantime, feel free to use, fork and expand at your own risk.

**Current version:** [0.4.4](https://github.com/resir014/NineSevenThree/releases)

## Features

* Basic UI & typography elements. Nothing fancy, just everything you need as a base for your web designing projects.
* Responsive, fluid, 12-column grids with a simple class system.
* Uses [Normalize.css](http://git.io/normalize)

## Building

NineSevenThree uses Grunt for building and testing CSS files.

### Requirements

* node.js v0.10.x - [Instructions](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Jekyll v0.10.x - [Instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Instructions

* Install Grunt with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
* Navigate to the root `NineSevenThree` directory, then run `npm install`. This will automatically install the required Node packages for building the files.
* Work on the CSS files inside the `_src` folder, then run `grunt test` to build a test CSS file.
